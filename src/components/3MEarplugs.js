                        <p className="Section6_heading2">Numerous studies have linked Paraquat, a commercial weed killer, to Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is an incurable neurological disease that kills nerve cells in the brain, leading to impaired brain function and movement.</p>

                        <p className="Section6_heading2">Victims claim the manufacturers of Paraquat failed to warn the public about the dangers of using the product. If you or someone you love developed Parkinson’s disease from using Paraquat, you can file a lawsuit that will compensate you for lost wages and medical bills. </p>

                        <p className="Section6_heading2">Filing a claim against Paraquat’s manufacturer could also encourage other manufacturers in the herbicide industry to test their products thoroughly before selling them.</p>

                        <h3 className="Section6_heading1_1">What is Paraquat?</h3>
                        <p className="Section6_heading2_1">Paraquat is a toxic herbicide widely-used for weed and grass control. It is available in liquid form in several different strengths in the United States. The product is classified as a “restricted use pesticide” by the FDA. This means that it can only be used by a licensed applicator. Because Paraquat is highly poisonous, it has a blue dye that keeps consumers from confusing the herbicide with other beverages. It also has a secondary chemical agent that will induce vomiting if someone drinks it by accident, along with a sharp odor to serve as a warning. These safeguards are not included outside of the United States.</p>

                        <p className="Section6_heading2_1">In 1961, Paraquat was produced for commercial use to kill over 100 different types of crops. It remains one of the most frequently used herbicides in the world. A person can be poisoned by Paraquat if their skin is accidentally exposed to the chemicals or through accidental ingestion. If a concentrated version of it is used or a person is exposed to it for long periods, poisoning is more likely to occur. It can also poison a person through a rash, cuts, or sores on their skin. Lung damage can occur if Paraquat is inhaled.</p>

                        <p className="Section6_heading2_1">When Paraquat enters the body, it is distributed evenly throughout a person’s system. The liver, lungs, kidneys, and other body parts can undergo toxic chemical reactions.</p>

                        <p className="Section6_heading2_1">Switzerland-based Syngenta ironically produced the product even though the country banned the use of the Paraquat in 1989. Thirty-two countries have banned Paraquat, but the United States has not.</p>
